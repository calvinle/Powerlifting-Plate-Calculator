# Powerlifting Plate Calculator (Android)

Designed for powerlifters and users of the Metric system, this Android app allows a user to input a valid weight number and calculate quantities of certain weight plates to load on a barbell. <br/>
"Valid" is defined as Metric (under the user's acknowledgement that USAPL uses Metric) and a multiple of 0.5. <br/>
A standard barbell is 20kg. When inputting a weight number, users should include the weight of the barbell, just like referring to it in any other situtation. <br/>
USAPL Collars are 2.5kg each and are used to secure weights to a barbell. As with the barbell, their weight should be included with the input weight. Users have the option to apply this, as they may not have the same applying collars outside of competitions.

## Bugs
- [ ] UI appears "squished" under certain aspect ratios similar to the Samsung Galaxy S8.
